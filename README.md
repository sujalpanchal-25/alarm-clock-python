# Alarm Clock in Python

## Overview

This is a simple Alarm Clock application built using Python.
The program allows the user to set a specific time, and when the system time matches the alarm time, an alarm sound is played.

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts and the use of external libraries.

## Features

* Set alarm using HH:MM:SS AM/PM format
* Displays current time continuously
* Plays alarm sound at the specified time
* Simple and beginner-friendly code

## Technologies Used

* Python
* datetime module
* time module
* pygame library

## Project Structure

Alarm.py – Main program
countdown.mp3 – Alarm sound file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sujalpanchal-25/alarm-clock-python.git
```

2. Install required library:
